✅ Why It Worked Without Git Bash
You pushed from Eclipse, which has built-in Git support (EGit plugin). Here's how it works:

🔧 Eclipse Internally Uses Git
Eclipse includes the EGit plugin

EGit is a Java-based implementation of Git

It handles Git operations like:

clone

commit

push

pull
→ All inside Eclipse GUI

✅ SSH Authentication Still Happened
When you cloned the repo using:

scss
Copy
Edit
git@github.com:NileshPawar98/TestProject.git
➡️ You used SSH protocol instead of HTTPS.

Earlier, you set up your SSH key and added it to GitHub

When Eclipse did the push, it used your SSH key in the background

Git Bash wasn’t needed, because:
✅ Eclipse → Java Git (JGit) → uses your SSH key → connects to GitHub → push successful!

🔐 Remember:
SSH key is stored in:

makefile
Copy
Edit
C:\Users\Admin\.ssh\id_ed25519
Git (whether used via Bash or Eclipse) uses that key when pushing to git@github.com

🎯 Summary
Action	Tool Used
Clone repo	Eclipse Git (EGit)
Share project	Eclipse Git
Commit	Eclipse Git
Push	Eclipse Git (using your SSH key)

👉 Git Bash is optional unless you prefer CLI.

Let me know if you'd like to:

Try pushing from Git Bash

Convert the project to Maven

Set up Selenium or .gitignore

You're using Git like a pro now 🔥
